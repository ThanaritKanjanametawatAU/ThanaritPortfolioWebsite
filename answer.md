1. Yeah that should be it
2. Make it nextJS-friendly alternatives
3. Convert to MDX for better NextJS integration
4. Modern development experience and Mainability
5. No, work at your own pace
6. NextJS 14 (latest with App Router)
7. Vercel (It will Automatically Deployed when Push)
8. Remove the form completely, I don't need it any more
9. Can I optimize using Tailwind's design system, slight variations is acceptable as long as the main theme and animation functionality is preserved.
10. Use a UI library like shadcn/ui for better components. Make sure that you're looking for up to date component to avoid mishaps.
11. I don't have any preferences for this. Any Optimization that has low risk of breaking the server works fine for me
12. No idea here. Come up with ways for SEO for me. When I search thanarit, thanarit.vercel.app should appear first. If that's not too hard for you to do, please do it, otherwise don't if it breaks the site.
13. Whatever work best with vercel and doesn't require much configuration.
14. I don't know any of these option. Please choose the option that will be the easiest to maintain and update regularly.
15. TypeScript must be the main language. Although there might be a lot of problems trying to deploy to vercel for type safety checl, so make sure that it can deploy seemlessly. CSS Modules + Tailwind. No specific configuration preferences.

Additional Notes: 
- I should not see html, css, js files as the main thing in the project. It should be tsx, ts, global.css, and tailwind related file. 
- The website is deployed on thanarit.vercel.app, so when finish reiterative development and testing locally, make sure to check thanarit.vercel.app with puppeteer to see if it works as expected. If not, then do reiterative development until it works.
- We should keep the old website page and create next app in the root of this project. 
So when I go to thanarit.vercel.app: I see new NextJS + Tailwind web app. 
When I go to thanarit.vercel.app/old: I see the old web pages I current have now.

Are we clear here? Any more clarification?
